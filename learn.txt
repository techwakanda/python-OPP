Python File Handling Basics

Reading and writing files is a fundamental skill in programming. Python makes file operations straightforward with built-in functions.

Key concepts:
- open() function opens files in different modes (read, write, append)
- with statement ensures files are properly closed
- read() gets the entire content as a string
- readlines() returns a list of lines
- write() puts content into files

Remember to handle exceptions when working with files:
- FileNotFoundError
- PermissionError
- UnicodeDecodeError

Practice makes perfect! Keep exploring different file operations in your Python journey.
