PYTHON FILE HANDLING BASICS

READING AND WRITING FILES IS A FUNDAMENTAL SKILL IN PROGRAMMING. PYTHON MAKES FILE OPERATIONS STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS.

KEY CONCEPTS:
- OPEN() FUNCTION OPENS FILES IN DIFFERENT MODES (READ, WRITE, APPEND)
- WITH STATEMENT ENSURES FILES ARE PROPERLY CLOSED
- READ() GETS THE ENTIRE CONTENT AS A STRING
- READLINES() RETURNS A LIST OF LINES
- WRITE() PUTS CONTENT INTO FILES

REMEMBER TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS WHEN WORKING WITH FILES:
- FILENOTFOUNDERROR
- PERMISSIONERROR
- UNICODEDECODEERROR

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT! KEEP EXPLORING DIFFERENT FILE OPERATIONS IN YOUR PYTHON JOURNEY.
